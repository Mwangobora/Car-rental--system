- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Version Control**: Git

## Tailwind CSS Integration

This project uses **Tailwind CSS** for styling. Tailwind is a utility-first CSS framework that enables rapid design and layout creation by providing utility classes directly in the markup.

### How Tailwind CSS is Used:

1. **Responsive Design**: Tailwind's responsive classes allow the layout to adapt across various screen sizes, making the app mobile-friendly and easy to use on any device.
2. **Utility-First Approach**: The project uses Tailwind's utility classes for margin, padding, typography, and flexbox to create a clean and efficient UI without writing custom CSS for every element.
3. **Customization**: The Tailwind configuration file (`tailwind.config.js`) allows customization of colors, fonts, and other design aspects to match the project's branding.
